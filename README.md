# FIGHT-THE-SLIME
A small game focused on integrating cheap arduino's sensors and PyGame

As is, this project uses HC-SR04 as the main source of serial data. While I could also give the arduino code as I update the project, it's better (for me) to create a separate section showcasing how to setup your arduino when everything's finished. And this is far from being finished. Some expected addons, when all the boring coding in python part is over with, are listed below:

1. Healing divine light (photoresistor);
2. AI magic wand using accelerometer (you can find billions of tutorials on Hackster.IO. I was inspired by Alex Miler's "Making Famous Magic Wand 33x Faster");
3. Joystick integration for pew pow and dodging.

Ultimately, using the serial port directly is boring, so I'll change it to something more fun.
